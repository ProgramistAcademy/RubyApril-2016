#How to use this repository

The first separation if based on weeks - starting from week 1.

In each week, there are markdown files with task descriptions in them.

Each week has a materials.md file, where we put the things that need to be checked first, before going into task-solving.

Usually, you will find code samples, links and videos about the topic of the week.
